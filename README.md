# Memory Game Project

## What is Memory game?

That's a funny and fast way to test and train your memory. You have to match the cards in the deck. The more you play - the faster you get!

## Instructions

* Click on a card and find the pairs.
* You can open two cards at a time.
* The game end when all the 8 pairs are made.

## How it's made?


The starting code is from Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. I used HTML, CSS, JS to:
* manipulate the DOM;
* create a list of cards and shuffle it;
* add a timer, move counter and star rating;
* create popup modal at the end of the game;
* change some styles and make the game responsive;

## Good luck and have fun!!!
